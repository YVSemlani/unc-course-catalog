# PUBH 720: HIV/AIDS Course

This course offers participants a multidisciplinary perspective on HIV/AIDS and COVID -- their etiology, immunology, epidemiology, and impact on individuals and society. How pandemics are framed by a society determines not only how affected persons are treated but also the degree to which the rights of the individual are upheld.
