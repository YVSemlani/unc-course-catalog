# ARTH 369: European Art and Sexuality

Between 1400 and 1600, major European artists (Hieronymus Bosch, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Titian, DÃ¼rer) made radical contributions to the representation of the sexual body. This course will use Northern European and Italian art as a lens for investigating Early Modern approaches to the figuration of sexuality and gender.
