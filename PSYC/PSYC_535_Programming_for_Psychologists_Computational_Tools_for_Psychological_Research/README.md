# PSYC 535: Programming for Psychologists: Computational Tools for Psychological Research

In this course, we will cover fundamental coding practices and computational tools used frequently in psychology research. We will go over the basics of coding, how to present computer-based experiments, how to keep a digital lab notebook, univariate data analyses, and visualization through programming. Through this process, students will have the opportunity to develop and run a simple experiment from start to finish.
