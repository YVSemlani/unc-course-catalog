# PSYC 438: Research Topics in the Psychology of Language

Examines the cognitive mechanisms behind language comprehension, focusing on how we make predictions about the speaker's meaning, based on context, background, gestures, and other cues. In this course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE), groups of students generate novel research questions, perform their own research experiments, and present the results in spoken and written format.
