# PSYC 571: Social Neuroscience

Social neuroscience is the study of how social processes and experiences are represented in and influence the structure and function of the brain. This course will focus primarily on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of humans, though we will also discuss other brain imaging techniques and patient studies. Previously offered as NSCI 571.
