# Course Syllabi Repository

Welcome to the Course Syllabi Repository! This platform allows students to upload course syllabi and relevant materials to help current and prospective students understand how courses are taught.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Department Level:** Each department has its own folder, e.g., `COMP` for Computer Science, `MATH` for Mathematics.
- **Course Level:** Within each department folder, courses are organized by Course Number -- Course Name, e.g., `1010-Introduction_to_Programming`.
- **Professor Level:** Inside each course folder, materials are organized by Professor's name.
- **Year Level:** Within each professor's folder, materials are organized by the Year they were taught.

**Example Structure:**

```
COMP/
└── 1010-Introduction_to_Programming/
    └── Professor_John_Doe/
        └── 2023/
            └── syllabus.pdf
```
