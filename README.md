# UNC Course Catalog Repository

Welcome to the UNC Course Catalog Repository! This student-run repository relies on uploads by students and other members of the UNC community to provide course syllabi and relevant materials, helping current and prospective students understand how courses are taught at UNC.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Department Level:** Each department has its own folder, e.g., `COMP` for Computer Science, `MATH` for Mathematics.
- **Course Level:** Within each department folder, courses are organized by Course Number -- Course Name, e.g., `210_Data_Structures_and_Analysis`.
- **Professor Level:** Inside each course folder, materials are organized by Professor's name.
- **Year Level:** Within each professor's folder, materials are organized by the Year they were taught.
- **Multiple Edition Level:** Some courses have multiple editions or sections. These are organized as subfolders within the main course folder, coming after the top-level course folder and before the professor subfolders, e.g., `COMP_590-177` and `COMP_590-170` under `COMP_590`.

**Example Structure:**

```
COMP/
└── COMP_210_Data_Structures_and_Analysis/
    └── Professor_Muhammad_Ghani/
        └── 2023/
            └── syllabus
            └── lecture_notes
            └── assignments
            └── etc.
```

**Multiple Course Editions Example Structure:**

```
