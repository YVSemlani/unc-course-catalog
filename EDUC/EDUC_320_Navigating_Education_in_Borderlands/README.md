# EDUC 320: Navigating Education in Borderlands

This course provides students a preliminary introduction to qualitative research methods as a mechanism for critically examining the concept of borders and implications for students' own educational experiences. While immersed in a geographic borderlands space, students will explore the "border" as not just the physical border between Mexico and the US, but as Gloria Anzald√∫a presents in her 1987 book Borderlands/ La Frontera, as a "psychic, social, and cultural terrain that we inhabit".
