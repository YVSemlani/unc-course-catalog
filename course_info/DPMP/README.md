# DPMP Course Catalog

## [DPMP 738. Nanomedicine. 3 Credits.](./DPMP_738_Nanomedicine)

Offers an introduction to the interdisciplinary field of nanomedicine for students with physical, chemical, or biological sciences background. It will emphasize emerging nanotechnologies and biomedical application.

## [DPMP 862. Advanced Physical Pharmacy. 1.5 Credits.
Discuss industrial approaches to pharmaceutical formulation development.

DPMP 863. Advanced Pharmaceutics II. 1.5 Credits.
Students will develop a strong understanding of the role of basic properties of the solutions and other compositions in preparation and development of pharmaceutical formulations and be able to apply the principles of experimental design and formulation in drug development. Students will further develop and extend their ability to integrate theory and practice to solve complex problems within multi-disciplinary contexts. DPMP 862 or pre-approval by course director is required. Strong physical/organic chemistry background is required.
