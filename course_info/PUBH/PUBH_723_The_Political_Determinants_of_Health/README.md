# PUBH 723: The Political Determinants of Health

The course uses Daniel Dawes' "The Political Determinants of Health" as its foundational text, with additional readings and resources to further supplement the students' understanding of how the political determinants - voting, government and public policy - operate to structure decisions and systems that allocate opportunities for people and communities to be healthy, to succeed and to thrive...or not.
