# PSYC 528: Clinical Research: Design, Analyze, Disseminate

Students work with a community partner to identify a research question related to our understanding and treatment of psychological health. Using an iterative scientific method, students collaborate to develop hypotheses, to prepare and analyze data, to propose interpretations of data, and to present their results to the public.
