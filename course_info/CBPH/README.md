CBPH 850. Modern Concepts in Cell Biology I. 4 Credits.

Permission of the instructor. Graduate students only. Discussion based course that covers key elements of cell, molecular, and developmental biology, and genetics. Students present and discuss breakthrough primary research papers under the direction of faculty members across the department. Minimal instructor lecturing is included.

## CBPH 851. Modern Concepts in Cell Biology II. 4 Credits.

Literature based discussion course on experimental approaches in Cell Biology. Emphasis is on small group discussion and dissection of primary literature including methods, scientific logic, and critical thinking. Each session typically includes both a discussion of key background by a faculty member and student led discussions of selected papers from the primary literature.

## CBPH 852. Experimental Physiology of Human Health and Disease. 4.5 Credits.
Students will learn the principles of cell, organ, and systems physiology and pathophysiology required to identify and understand important areas of current biomedical research. This course will focus on non-human model systems (cultured cells, mice, drosophila, etc.). In addition to lectures, this course will include journal-club discussion of assigned papers.

CBPH 853. Experimental Physiology of Human Health and Disease. 4.5 Credits.
Permission of the instructor. Molecular and cellular basis of organ system function; integration of systems to maintain the normal state. Understanding of normal physiology is amplified by examples from human disease and mouse models. Principles of cell, organ, and integrative physiology and how these principles apply to translational research.

CBPH 855. Career and Research Enhancement Seminar (CaRES). 1-2.5 Credits.
Permission of the director of graduate studies.

CBPH 856. Career and Research Enhancement Seminar (CaRES). 1-2.5 Credits.
Permission of the director of graduate studies.

CBPH 890. Special Topics in Cell Biology & Physiology. 1-5 Credits.
Modern day exploration of topics or methodologies of interest to PhD students in biomedical sciences. New or old relevant technologies/methodologies or subject areas of research, and/or professional skills enhancement will be addressed. This could be either for enhancing knowledge of subject materials or teaching skill sets (e.g., statistics) needed for biomedical researchers.

CBPH 895. Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR). 1 Credits.

Responsible conduct of research is a classroom-based graduate level course covering critical topics for ethical and responsible conduct of experimental research. There are both classroom lecture, workshop-type discussion components, in addition to assigned outside of class readings. Topics include: mentor and mentee relationships, publication authorship, collaboration, peer review, ethical use of human and animal subjects, conflicts of interest, intellectual property, plagiarism, data acquisition, and data processing.
