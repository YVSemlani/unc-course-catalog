# MEJO 625: Media Hub

Permission of the department. Students will work together to find, produce, and market stories that would attract the attention of professional media partners throughout the state and region, and at times, the nation. This hands-on course mimics the professional journalist's work environment more than any other class in the school. Honors version available.
