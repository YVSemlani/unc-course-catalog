# ARTH 112: The Art of Animals: Africa and Beyond

This class views the relationship between humans and animals through works of art. Drawing examples from cultures across the world, we address animals as symbols of leadership, beauty, and extraordinary powers. Elephants, leopards, spiders, and dogs of all kinds, along with many other mammals, reptiles, birds, and insects will be studied.
