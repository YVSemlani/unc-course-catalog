# ARTH 250: Objects, Museums, and Meanings

This course explores objects and meaning in the context of museums. How does one "read" an object? What do works of art communicate on their own, and how do a series of decisions - made by individuals and institutions - shape how we understand them? Through museum visits, object-based learning and research, readings, and discussion, this course will consider how objects, and their collection and display, shape our understanding of the world around us. Honors version available.
