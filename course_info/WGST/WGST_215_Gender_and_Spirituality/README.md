# WGST 215: Gender and Spirituality

The course is designed to introduce a variety of ways that gender is present in how we define, interpret, and engage the broad categories of the spiritual and spiritualities. Students will learn how to analyze how gender is portrayed by spiritual and religious traditions and reflect on the socially constructed nature of those encounters.
