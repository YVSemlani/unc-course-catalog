## [ORPA 731. Surgical Oral Pathology Seminar. 1-3 Credits.
This weekly seminar uses unknown cases as the basis for discussion of a variety of biopsy specimens taken from the head and neck. Clinical management of cases also is discussed. Students will develop skills for interacting with their medical and dental colleagues.

ORPA 732. Current Perspectives on Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology. 1-3 Credits.
This seminar series will focus on current research in oral and maxillofacial pathology (OMP) and related fields. Current scientific literature will be critically reviewed. In addition, students will review historical literature to gain a perspective on the development of OMP as a specialty.

ORPA 733. Advanced Oral Pathology. 1-3 Credits.
This lecture and clinicopathologic correlation series includes study of the etiology, pathogenesis, clinical, and histopathologic aspects of diseases of the head and neck.

ORPA 750. Surgical Pathology in the Hospital Setting. 1-3 Credits.
Under the supervision of the hospital pathologists, the student will rotate in anatomic pathology, laboratory medicine, dermatopathology, hematopathology, molecular medicine, surgical specialties, and other elective areas to develop advanced concepts of disease as well as a working relationship with medical colleagues.
