# GNET 744: Biological Sequence Analysis, Protein-Structure, and Genome-Wide Data

This module provides an introduction to basic protein structure/function analyses combining sequence informatics and macromolecular structure. In the second half the focus will switch to analysis of genome-wide datasets and methods used for the analysis of such "big data."
