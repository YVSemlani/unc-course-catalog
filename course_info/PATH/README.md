PATH_730_Cancer_Immunology)

The goal of this graduate-level course is to learn about recent advances in the field, acquire specialized knowledge and to develop a foundation of critical thinking skills in cancer immunology. The course format will combine lectures and in-class discussion of assigned readings, with particular emphasis on state-of-the art research methods. Students should be familiar with modern concepts of immunology and should consult with the course director before enrolling. The course meets for half a semester.

## [PATH 766. Current Topics in Cardiovascular Biology. 3 Credits.](./PATH_766_Current_Topics_in_Cardiovascular_Biology)

Permission of the instructor. Second-year graduate students only. This manuscript-based course will emphasize recent advances in heart and blood vessel development, the molecular mechanisms that regulate cardiovascular cell function, and current methodologies in the cardiovascular field. It will be team taught by members of UNC's McAllister Heart Institute.

## [PATH 767. Molecular and Cellular Biology of Cardiovascular Diseases. 3 Credits.](./PATH_767_Molecular_and_Cellular_Biology_of_Cardiovascular_Diseases)
