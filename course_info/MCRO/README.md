## MCRO 449. Introduction to Immunology. 3 Credits.

This course provides a general overview of the evolution, organization, and function of the immune system. Instruction will be inquiry-based with extensive use of informational and instructional technology tools.

## MCRO 614. Immunobiology. 3 Credits.

A strong background in molecular biology, eukaryotic genetics, and biochemistry is required. Advanced survey course with topics that include molecular recognition, genetic mechanisms of host resistance, development of cells and cell interactions; hypersensitivity, autoimmunity, and resistance to infection. Course material from textbook and primary literature.

## MCRO 630. Virology. 3 Credits.

Required preparation, coursework in molecular biology and cell biology. Current concepts of the chemistry, structure, replication, genetics, and the natural history of animal viruses and their host cells.

## MCRO 631. Advanced Molecular Biology. 4 Credits.

This course explores cutting edge research in molecular biology -- the investigation at molecule-scale of the mechanisms behind life. We briefly review core-principles in molecular biology, then investigate more recent research that extends or overturns these core principles.

## MCRO 632. Advanced Molecular Biology II. 3 Credits.

Required preparation for undergraduates, at least one undergraduate course in both biochemistry and genetics. The purpose of this course is to provide historical, basic, and current information about the flow and regulation of genetic information from DNA to RNA in a variety of biological systems. Three lecture hours a week.

## MCRO 635. Microbial Pathogenesis I. 3 Credits.

Permission of the instructor. Required preparation, coursework in molecular biology and genetics. Topics will include aspects of basic bacteriology as well as bacterial and fungal pathogens and mechanisms of disease.

## MCRO 640. Microbial Pathogenesis II. 3 Credits.

Permission of the instructor or a fundamental understanding of molecular virology and immunology. Molecular pathogenesis, with a primary focus on viral pathogens. Additional topics include vaccines and genetics of host-pathogen interactions.

## MCRO 690. Special Topics in Microbiology or Immunology. 1-15 Credits.
Permission of the department except for department majors. Designed to introduce the student to research methods. Minor investigative problems are conducted with advice and guidance of the staff. Hours and credit to be arranged, any term. May be repeated for credit two or more semesters.

MCRO 701. Seminar in Microbiology and Immunology. 1 Credits.

Faculty and student seminars on current research in microbiology and immunology.

Seminar on selected topics in microbiology.

## MCRO 705. Data and Molecular Visualization for Biomedical Research. 2 Credits.

This is an introductory course focused on methods to visualize scientific data and molecular structures. The course will include: R to visualize various biomedical data and generate multiple publication-ready figures and tables, phylogenetic analysis using R and other tools, and PyMol to visualize and analyze molecular structures and create images for publication. This course will also include a large codebase on using R and state-of-art packages to summarize and visualize various data types.

## MCRO 710. Seminar/Tutorial in Bacterial and Eukaryotic Microbes. 1-15 Credits.
One or two faculty and a small number of students will consider current research of importance in depth. Emphasis is on current literature, invited speakers, etc., rather than textbooks.

MCRO 711. Seminar/Tutorial in Animal Virology. 1-15 Credits.
One or two faculty and a small number of students consider current research of importance in depth. Emphasis is on current literature, invited speakers, etc., rather than textbooks.

MCRO 712. Seminar/Tutorial in Immunology. 1-15 Credits.
One or two faculty and a small number of students consider current research of importance in depth. Emphasis is on current literature, invited speakers, etc., rather than textbooks.

MCRO 721. Refresher Training in the Responsible Conduct of Research. 1 Credits.

MCRO 721 is a modular course that meets the requirements of the National Institutes of Health for refresher training in the Responsible Conduct of Research. The course involves a mixture of assigned readings, formal presentations by department faculty who are active in research, and small group discussions. The course grade is based on attendance and participation.

## MCRO 730. Cancer Immunology. 2 Credits.

The goal of this graduate-level course is to learn about recent advances in the field, acquire specialized knowledge and to develop a foundation of critical thinking skills in cancer immunology. The course format will combine lectures and in-class discussion of assigned readings, with particular emphasis on state-of-the art research methods. Students should be familiar with modern concepts of immunology and should consult with the course director before enrolling. The course meets for half a semester.

## MCRO 790. Directed Readings in Prokaryotic Molecular Biology. 1 Credits.

Permission of the instructor or one prior prokaryotic molecular biology course. Directed readings in prokaryotic molecular biology under the direction of a member of the graduate faculty. May be repeated for credit.
