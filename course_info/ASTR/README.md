## [ASTR 63. First-Year Seminar: Catastrophe and Chaos: Unpredictable Physics. 3 Credits.](./ASTR_63_First-Year_Seminar_Catastrophe_and_Chaos_Unpredictable_Physics)

Physics is often seen as the most precise and deterministic of sciences. Determinism can break down, however. This seminar explores the rich and diverse areas of modern physics in which "unpredictability" is the norm. Honors version available.

## [ASTR 89. First-Year Seminar: Special Topics. 3 Credits.](./ASTR_89_First-Year_Seminar_Special_Topics)

Special topics course content will vary each semester.

They will also use Skynet's radio telescopes to explore the invisible universe, including pulsars, supernova remnants, and supermassive black holes. Astrophotography will be our entry point to deeper explorations of the solar system; star birth, evolution, and death; galaxy formation and evolution; and black holes and Einstein's theory of relativity.

## [ASTR 111. Educational Research in Radio Astronomy. 1-3 Credits.
One-week field experience at Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia. Students observe the invisible universe using manually controlled and fully automated radio telescopes, and carry out a variety of observing projects.
