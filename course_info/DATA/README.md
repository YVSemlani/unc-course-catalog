## [DATA 130. Critical Data Literacy. 3 Credits.](./DATA_130_Critical_Data_Literacy)

How do you become data literate? Data literacy is the ability to read, write, and communicate data in context, or in other words: perform data analysis, construct a data visualization, and then communicate that data. It is the story that gets told with the data. Data literacy helps us to understand data, learn about different types and scales of data, and understand why this is important in the world today.

## [DATA 140. Introduction to Data Structures and Management. 3 Credits.](./DATA_140_Introduction_to_Data_Structures_and_Management)

Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data for use in our databases and indexing services. A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. There are several basic and advanced types of data structures, all designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose. Data structures make it easy for users to access and work with the data they need in appropriate ways.

## [DATA 150. Communication for Data Scientists. 3 Credits.](./DATA_150_Communication_for_Data_Scientists)

The ability to collect and analyze data has changed virtually every field, yet data scientists often lack the ability to present their findings in effective formats. This class uses storytelling to help you connect with your audience and present your data in compelling and understandable ways so stakeholders can make the right decisions with data. Through hands-on exercises, you'll learn the advantages and disadvantages of oral, visual, and written formats.

## [DATA 710. Introduction to Applied Data Science. 3 Credits.](./DATA_710_Introduction_to_Applied_Data_Science)

## [DATA 720. Programming Methods for Data Science. 3 Credits.](./DATA_720_Programming_Methods_for_Data_Science)

This course will provide students with advanced concepts on the construction and use of data structures and their associated algorithms. Concepts covered in this course will include: abstract data types, lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs; sorting, searching, hashing, and an introduction to numerical error control; techniques of algorithm analysis and problem-solving paradigms using relevant programming languages and tools.

## [DATA 730. Statistical Modeling and Inference for Data Science. 3 Credits.](./DATA_730_Statistical_Modeling_and_Inference_for_Data_Science)

The course will be coding-oriented and cover concepts such as foundations in probability, including basic rules, Bayes' theorem, and basic distributions; sampling and the central limit theorem; bootstrapping, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, and multiple testing; linear models, basic and multiple regression, inference for regression, regularization; classification, logistic regression, and tree-based methods; and prediction, model interpretation, and model evaluation.

## [DATA 740. Governance, Bias, and Ethics in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. 3 Credits.](./DATA_740_Governance_Bias_and_Ethics_in_Data_Science_and_Artificial_Intelligence)

We will explore the foundational concepts of ethics in data science and AI. This overview will set the stage for a deep understanding of what ethical frameworks mean in practice, providing students the opportunity to create actionable examples. By focusing on a wide variety of case studies throughout a myriad of industries and settings, this class will develop leaders who can effectively integrate and leverage data science solutions while ensuring responsible use of data.

## [DATA 750. Mathematical Tools for Data Science. 3 Credits.](./DATA_750_Mathematical_Tools_for_Data_Science)

This course will present the mathematical intuition, theory, and techniques driving the numerical computation methods used for processing and analyzing data in various real-life problems. Topics include dimensionality reduction; linear and non-linear approximation; frequency and wavelet analysis; and a glimpse into the mathematics of deep neural networks, classification, large-scale and high-performance numerical computing, and visualization.
