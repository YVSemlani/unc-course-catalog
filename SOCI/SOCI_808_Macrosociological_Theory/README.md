# SOCI 808: Macrosociological Theory

The objective of the course is to illustrate three aspects of macrosociological theory: 1) the conception of macrosociology, 2) the structural approach in sociology and 3) hypothetico-deductive theorizing. A hypothetico-deductive macrostructural theory developed by the instructor is analyzed, and extensive empirical tests of the theory are presented.
