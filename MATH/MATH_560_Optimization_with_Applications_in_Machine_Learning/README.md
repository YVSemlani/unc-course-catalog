# MATH 560: Optimization with Applications in Machine Learning

This course will provide an introduction to convex optimization, including convex sets and functions, modeling, conic problems, optimality conditions and algorithms. The second part of the course will address non-convex problems, focusing on contemporary optimization challenges in large-scale optimization and practical approaches for machine learning and deep learning.
