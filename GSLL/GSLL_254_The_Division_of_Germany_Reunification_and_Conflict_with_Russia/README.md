# GSLL 254: The Division of Germany, Reunification, and Conflict with Russia

Why was occupied Germany divided into two states after World War II? Were the Cold War and division inevitable? We explore these questions in two chronological contexts: 1945-1949 and 1989-present, with emphasis on the reemergence of Western conflict with Putin's Russia. Readings and discussions in English. Previously offered as GERM 254. Honors version available.
