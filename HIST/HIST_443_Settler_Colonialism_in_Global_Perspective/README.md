# HIST 443: Settler Colonialism in Global Perspective

It investigates how settler colonial polities consolidated during and after the global "settler revolution," how they managed relations with the imperial metropole and dealt with the Indigenous populations, whose resistance, adaptation, survival and agency also feature.
