# HIST 256: France, 1940 to the Present

Three events shaped contemporary France: collaboration and resistance in occupied France; the Algerian War; and the political, cultural, and social movements in the late 1960s and 1970s. This class will examine these events, how they are remembered and given meaning, and their role in making the France we know today. Honors version available.
