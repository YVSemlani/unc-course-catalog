# COMP 211: Systems Fundamentals

This is the first course in the introductory systems sequence. Students enter the course having taken an introductory programming course in a high-level programming language (COMP 110) and a course in discrete structures. The overarching goal is to bridge the gap between a students' knowledge of a high-level programming language (COMP 110) and computer organization (COMP 311).
