# COMP 311: Computer Organization

Introduction to computer organization and design. Students will be introduced to the conceptual design of a basic microprocessor, along with assembly programming. The course includes fundamental concepts such as binary numbers, binary arithmetic, and representing information as well as instructions. Students learn to program in assembly (i.e., machine) language. The course covers the fundamentals of computer hardware design, transistors and logic gates, progressing through basic combinational and sequential components, culminating in the conceptual design CPU.
