# ENGL 674: Digital Literature

Digital literature explores how literary works are composed for, shaped by, and studied in electronic environments. Course texts range from books to electronic fiction and poetry to video games. Hands-on activities give students a chance to develop their own literary projects--either as electronic literary works or as digital scholarship.
