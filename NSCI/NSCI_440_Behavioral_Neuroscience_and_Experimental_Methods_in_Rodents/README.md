# NSCI 440: Behavioral Neuroscience and Experimental Methods in Rodents

This is to survey the wide variety of experimental methods used in rodent studies to assess behavioral outcomes, including memory, anxiety, depression, and drug seeking. This will be combined with readings on how changes in brain circuitry can affect behavioral outcomes, such as drugs of abuse or other disease states.
