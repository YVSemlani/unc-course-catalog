# COMM 337: Visual Storytelling for Screenwriters

Priority given to majors. This course instructs students on how to tell stories in a visual manner. How do the words on a page get translated onto a screen and how will the writer collaborate visually with a director? It is designed for writers to better understand how their scripts are interpreted and to improve visual writing.
