# CMPL 150: Critical Theory: Fear, Love, Laughter, and Loss - Film Genres and Spectatorship

Why do we laugh, cry, cringe, or scream at the movies? We will study emotionally intense genres such as melodrama, comedy and horror to think about effective responses to films. Students practice film analysis, gain an overview over genre cinema, and study approaches to emotion, affect, and the body.
