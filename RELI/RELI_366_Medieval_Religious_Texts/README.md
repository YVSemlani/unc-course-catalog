# RELI 366: Medieval Religious Texts

In this course students will read major medieval religious texts (Christian, Jewish, and/or Muslim), that permit close study of religious life, culture, and thought during the Middle Ages (broadly defined). The works will be in English translation, but students with appropriate linguistic knowledge may read the texts in their original language.
